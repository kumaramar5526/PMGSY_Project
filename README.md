An intelligent classification system to automatically categorize rural infrastructure projects under PMGSY schemes (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA) using Machine Learning (XGBoost Classifier). This project involves data preprocessing, model development, and deployment on IBM Cloud as an API for real-time scheme prediction.
